All that you need is a US Super Mario 64 rom, named baserom.us.z64
It can be either in the root of downloads or in the root of internal storage either way it will probably find it!

The external SM64EX builds need the base.zip moved to Android/data/files/res/ the base.zip is located inside the SM64 Builder in the sm64-izzys-port-android/build/us_pc/res/ folder.

Please consider donating so I can continue working on this and other projects. Thank you!
